The application form to the dashboard in the Loan Manager project, focusing on backend development using TypeScript with Node.js. The primary goal is to handle user inputs effectively and ensure the dashboard works as expected

Please find the Figma design for the project linked below:
https://www.figma.com/file/vSeMzFkJ6RKdtflUaQvi9T/LOAN-MANAGER-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=61OOCgRHlv2RXuvJ-0

Requirements:
1. Technology Stack:
Backend:

Node.js with TypeScript
Express.js (optional, for API handling)
Database: MongoDB (or any suitable database of your choice)
Frontend (Dashboard):

React.js or any preferred frontend framework (for the purpose of integrating with the backend)
2. Functional Requirements:
Form Integration:

The application form should be connected to the backend to accept inputs from users.
Users should be able to submit application forms that will store their data in the backend.
Dashboard:

The dashboard should reflect accurate statistics based on the submitted data.
Ensure the data in the dashboard updates dynamically as users submit their application forms.
User Inputs:

Handle multiple users' inputs efficiently and ensure that the data is stored properly in the database.
Design the backend in a way that ensures each userâ€™s data is unique and retrievable.
Statistics:

The dashboard should calculate and display statistics such as total applications, average loan amount, application success rate, etc., in real-time.
Align these statistics with the Figma design.
3. Design Adjustment:
You may make adjustments to the Figma design to improve functionality but no need to design the graphs.
The focus should be on backend development while integrating the form with the dashboard.
